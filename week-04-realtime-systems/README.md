# Week 4: Real-time Systems & WebSocket Communication

## 🏢 AlgoCratic Futures: Corporate Real-time Infrastructure

**"Instantaneous Corporate Coordination Through Algorithmic Communication Channels"**

### 📡 Learning Objectives

Building on Week 3's event-driven architecture, Week 4 focuses on **real-time communication patterns** that enable instant coordination across distributed corporate systems:

- **WebSocket Protocol**: Bidirectional, low-latency communication
- **Server-Sent Events**: Efficient one-way data streaming
- **Real-time Patterns**: Chat, notifications, live dashboards, presence detection
- **Connection Management**: Handling disconnections, reconnections, and scaling
- **Advanced Features**: Rooms, broadcasting, message queuing, rate limiting

### 🎯 Week 4 Assessment Criteria

**"Event-driven architecture with multiple services"** - Students must demonstrate:
- WebSocket server handling multiple concurrent connections
- Real-time message broadcasting across connected clients
- Proper connection lifecycle management
- Integration with Week 3's message bus patterns
- Error handling and graceful degradation under load

### 🏗️ Architecture Progression

**Week 1**: Async foundations → **Week 2**: Service coordination → **Week 3**: Event-driven messaging → **Week 4**: Real-time communication

### 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start WebSocket server
