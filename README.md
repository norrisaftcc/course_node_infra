## 🎭 AlgoCratic Futures Theme

A satirical corporate framework that transforms technical concepts into memorable scenarios:
- **Async operations** = "Algorithmic productivity recalibration"
- **Service coordination** = "Multi-departmental efficiency optimization"
- **Event systems** = "Corporate communication infrastructure"
- **Real-time systems** = "Instantaneous coordination protocols"
- **Distributed transactions** = "Enterprise workflow orchestration"

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Primary coordination layer and API gateway
- **Express.js**: Web framework for service architecture
- **WebSockets/Socket.IO**: Real-time communication
- **Custom Message Bus**: "Kafka-enough" for educational simplicity
- **Docker/Docker Compose**: Container orchestration
- **Integration Ready**: Seamless migration to production Kafka

## 📚 Current Development Status

**✅ Completed: Week 4 - Real-time Systems & WebSocket Communication**

### Completed Modules:
- ✅ **Week 1**: Async Foundations with Promise patterns and AlgoCratic theming
- ✅ **Week 2**: Service Coordination with Express.js and multi-service architecture 
- ✅ **Week 3**: Event-driven patterns with EventEmitter, streams, and message queues
- ✅ **Week 4**: Real-time systems with WebSockets, SSE, and live dashboards

### Next Steps:
- 🎯 **Week 5**: Saga patterns and distributed transaction coordination
- Week 6: Observability and monitoring  
- Week 7: Docker Compose and container orchestration
- Week 8: Production-ready microservices scaffold

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each week includes consistent commands for easy navigation:

```bash
# Install dependencies for any week
cd week-XX-topic/
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run demonstrations
npm run demo

# Execute exercises
npm run test

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## 🎓 Educational Approach

### Progressive Complexity
Each week builds directly on previous concepts:
- Week 1 async → Week 2 services → Week 3 events → Week 4 real-time → Week 5 sagas

### Practical Application
- Real corporate scenarios with memorable AlgoCratic theming
- Working code that demonstrates production patterns
- Integration points that scale to enterprise Kafka deployments

### Assessment Integration
- Weekly exercises with automated testing frameworks
- Progressive skill validation building to capstone projects
- Production-ready patterns suitable for enterprise deployment

## 🏢 Enterprise Readiness

### Kafka Migration Path
The course's "Kafka-enough" message bus is designed for seamless enterprise migration:
- Educational message topics → Production Kafka topics
- Simple producers/consumers → Enterprise Kafka clients  
- Course monitoring → Kafka Connect and Schema Registry
- Development patterns → Production distributed systems

### Production Patterns
All code follows enterprise standards:
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Resource cleanup and memory management
- Security considerations and rate limiting
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Docker deployment preparation

## 📖 Documentation Structure

- **README.md**: Course overview and navigation
- **CLAUDE.md**: AI assistant project context and instructions
- **STUDENT-NOTES.md**: Common challenges and solutions for each week
- **docs/**: Course planning, progression notes, and architectural decisions
