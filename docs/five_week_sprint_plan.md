## RISK MANAGEMENT & DEPENDENCIES

### High-Risk Items
1. **Kafka Learning Curve** (Week 3)
   - **Mitigation**: Use Docker Compose setup, focus on patterns over configuration
   - **Fallback**: Simplified messaging with Redis pub/sub if Kafka proves too complex

2. **Time Management** (Dual tracks)
   - **Mitigation**: Technical learning drives instructional design (learn first, teach second)
   - **Buffer**: Week 5 has extra instructional design time

3. **Technical Depth vs Teaching Readiness**
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on patterns students need, not Node.js mastery
   - **Success Metric**: Can anticipate and debug student problems

### Critical Dependencies
- Week 1 technical completion → Week 1 materials creation
- Kafka working (Week 3) → Advanced patterns (Week 4)
- Complete technical scaffold → Final curriculum assembly

---

## WEEKLY COMMITMENTS

### Time Allocation per Week:
- **Technical Learning**: 6 hours/week (focus time, hands-on building)
- **Instructional Design**: 2-3 hours/week (weeks 1-4), 6 hours (week 5)
- **Total**: ~8-9 hours/week

### Daily Schedule Recommendation:
- **Monday/Wednesday**: 3-hour technical sessions (deep focus)
- **Friday**: 2-3 hour instructional design session (creative work)
- **Weekend**: Buffer time for integration and testing

---

## DELIVERABLE CHECKPOINTS

### End of Week 2:
- [ ] Working 4-service coordination system
- [ ] Student materials for Weeks 1-2 complete
- [ ] Confidence teaching async fundamentals

### End of Week 4:

## SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE QUESTIONS

**Weekly Check-ins**:
1. Is the technical learning translating to teachable concepts?
2. Are the student materials realistic for the target skill level?
3. What student confusion points am I discovering during my own learning?

**Final Retrospective**:
1. Which patterns were harder to learn than expected? (Students will struggle here too)
2. What would I teach differently based on my learning experience?
3. Where do I need more practice before teaching students?

---

**SPRINT COMMITMENT**: By Week 5, you'll be ready to guide students through distributed systems discovery with confidence, working examples, and proven troubleshooting skills.

**DEFINITION OF DONE**: Can successfully teach the 8-week student program without referring to external documentation during class sessions.
