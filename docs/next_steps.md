Perfect! This sprint plan balances your dual responsibilities as both student and curriculum designer. The key insight is that your technical learning experience becomes valuable instructional design input - when you struggle with a concept, that's exactly where students will struggle too.

The plan front-loads the technical learning each week, then uses that fresh experience to create realistic student materials. Week 5 gives you integration time and extra curriculum development hours since that's when everything needs to come together.

The risk mitigation around Kafka (Week 3) is important since that's typically the most complex part for both instructors and students. Having a Redis fallback keeps you moving if Docker Compose Kafka proves stubborn.

The success metrics focus on teaching readiness rather than Node.js mastery - you need to be one step ahead of students, not a Node.js expert. Your C++/Python background actually helps here since you'll naturally think about concepts in ways that transfer to other languages.
