# ALGOCRATIC FUTURES NODE.JS INTEGRATION
## Technical Documentation and Implementation Guide

**PROJECT TYPE**: Educational Framework Enhancement  
**SCOPE**: Node.js curriculum integration with distributed systems preparation  
**TARGET AUDIENCE**: CS2/Intermediate programming students  
**IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**: 8-week module + ongoing capstone support

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project extends the existing AlgoCratic Futures educational framework with Node.js curriculum specifically designed to prepare students for distributed microservices architecture in capstone projects. The implementation treats Node.js as infrastructure tooling while allowing students to implement business logic in their preferred languages (Python, Java).

### Core Value Proposition
Students learn asynchronous programming patterns through Node.js, then apply these coordination concepts to distributed systems design. This approach provides a practical foundation for capstone projects requiring microservices architecture without forcing language changes for application development.

## ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH

### Educational Framework Integration
The Node.js curriculum integrates with the existing AlgoCratic Futures satirical corporate simulation while maintaining focus on practical skill development. The theatrical elements provide engagement and memorable learning experiences without overwhelming the technical content.

### Technology Stack Decision Matrix
- **Node.js**: API gateway, message routing, real-time features, service coordination
- **Python/Java**: Business logic, data processing, machine learning components
- **Kafka**: Message bus for async communication between services
- **Docker/Docker Compose**: Container orchestration and deployment
- **Express.js**: Web framework for API development
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication features

### Learning Progression Architecture
The curriculum follows a systematic progression from single-process async programming to distributed systems coordination:

1. **Foundations** (Weeks 1-2): Basic async patterns and Promise coordination
2. **Service Integration** (Weeks 3-4): Event-driven architecture and Kafka messaging
3. **System Design** (Weeks 5-6): Transaction coordination and observability
4. **Production Readiness** (Weeks 7-8): Deployment and orchestration
